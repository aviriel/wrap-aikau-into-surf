Wrapping Aikau pages into Surf pages in Alfresco Share

Sometimes you want to see your new Aikau page as old Surf page. Why can you need it?
* Making your new page the default landing page in Alfresco
* Converting "/share/page/hdp/ws/NEW_PAGE" to the nice "/share/page/NEW_PAGE" URL
* Many other situations

Originally this code is written by @AFaust. I just copied it from IRC channel and created a project based on Alfresco Maven SDK 2.1.1.
